For a better looking source tree (that isn't just 1_xx_x spam), I use custom version identifiers.

Identifiers are chosen based on the first notable supported version of any given jar.

If a version has nothing notable, we choose a name for another close version and use that.

### Versions

| Cake        | b1.2     |
| Cookie      | b1.4     |
