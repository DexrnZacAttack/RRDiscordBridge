For a better looking source tree (that isn't just 1_xx_x spam), I use custom version identifiers.

Identifiers are chosen based on the first notable supported version of any given jar.

If a version has nothing notable, we choose a name for another close version and use that.

### Versions
| Name    | Version |
|---------|---------|
| Cake    | b1.2    |
| Cookie  | b1.4    |
| Flat    | 1.1     |
| Emerald | 1.3.1   |
| Realms  | 1.7.9   |
| Color   | 1.12    |
| Nether  | 1.16    |
| Wild    | 1.19    |
| Allay   | 1.19.1  |
| Vex     | 1.19.3  |
| Trails  | 1.20.1  |
| Trade   | 1.20.2  |
| Pot     | 1.20.3  |
